# Gif Project!

### Details on the assignment
This is the creation of a giphy button webpage using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of choice. This app is useful because it shows how you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

### Why make this?
This project is useful because it shows how Ajax can be used to call data from API and use it on a webpage. 

### How you create the webpage

The webpage is created by pseudo-coding all of the steps in detail. Then you must link the API to your code using Ajax so that data (gifs) can be pulled and then shown on your webpage. Buttons are created for each holiday you input and 10 gifs are shown for each button you create/press using jQuery and Javascript. Each gif must pause and play everytime you click it which is also set up using jQuery and Javascript.

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, and W3 Schools which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (Google Fu!) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself!

Put your knowledge to the test! Good luck!
